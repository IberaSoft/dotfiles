# dotfiles
## What's inside

All my config files.

## Install

Make sure that you are in your home directory and run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/IberaSoft/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
